# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node 22.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quick Start

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Overview

### Real-time weather data retrieval
Our app fetches real-time weather data for any city across the globe, providing users with the most up-to-date information available.

### Comprehensive weather information
Users can access both current weather conditions and detailed forecasts to plan their activities accordingly.

### Immersive animations
Upon launching the app and while scrolling through weather details, users are treated to visually stunning animations that enhance their experience.

### Responsive design
Our app is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that users can access weather information conveniently no matter what device they're using.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
